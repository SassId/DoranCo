There are 2 types of database:

    - relational (SQL) (Structured Query Language)
        - MySQL
        - Postres
    Theses are like 50yo and are structured as tables
    They're linked to each others in 1 to 1, 1 to many and many to many
    (ex: 1 user to many posts; many likes to many posts, 1 user to 1 profile)

    - document (NoSQL)
        - mongoDB
    They are json files (JavaScript Object Notation)

    Schema: defines the structures of the database
    Model: allows to interact with the DB by using its methods

    In our case:

    Client = Postman -->http---> Server = Express --->mongoose---> mongoDB
    (and back)

    //OBJECTS CLASSES MODEL

Class = plan of construction of an object

Object = instance of the class = prototype

A static function can be used on the class

An instance function needs the instance to be called

ex:

class User = {
    consctructor(id, name, age) {
        this.id = id
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }
    displayName(){
        console.log("this.name")
    }
}

// useEffect()
allows us to execute functions after the component has been executed
we use it to make http requests in a asynchrone way (we call that a field effect)
!! as we have to await fetch(), it has to be inside an async function
!! but the declaration of a react component has to be instantaneous
this fonction is executed only when the whole is refreshed.
it takes 2 parameters : an arrow function and an empty array (array of dependencies)
!! if we omit the array of dependencies, the function is executed infinitely

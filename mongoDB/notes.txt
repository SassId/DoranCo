There are 2 types of database:

    - relational (SQL) (Structured Query Language)
        - MySQL
        - Postres
    Theses are like 50yo and are structured as tables
    They're linked to each others in 1 to 1, 1 to many and many to many
    (ex: 1 user to many posts; many likes to many posts, 1 user to 1 profile)

    - document (NoSQL)
        - mongoDB
    They are json files (JavaScript Object Notation)

    Schema: defines the structures of the database
    Model: allows to interact with the DB by using its methods

    In our case:

    Client = Postman -->http---> Server = Express --->mongoose---> mongoDB
    (and back)
